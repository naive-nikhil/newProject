We work in agile sprints to ensure you see regular progress.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure my digital marketing budget isn't wasted?",

Our approach involves: <ul class='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1'><li>Precise audience targeting</li><li>A/B testing ad creatives</li><li>Continuous campaign optimization</li><li>Transparent monthly reporting</li></ul>",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you develop for both iOS and Android?",

    },
    {
        question: "What is your approach to SEO?",
        answer: "We don't believe in shortcuts. Our SEO strategy is built on three pillars: <strong>Technical SEO</strong> (site speed, mobile-friendliness), <strong>Content Strategy</strong> (relevant, high-value keywords), and <strong>Authority Building</strong> (quality backlinks). This ensures sustainable, long-term rankings on Google.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer support after the project is launched?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Digital products need care to stay secure and fast. We offer flexible <strong>Maintenance Packages</strong> that cover security patches, server monitoring, content updates, and bug fixes so you can focus on running your business while we handle the tech.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help with branding if I don't have a logo or identity?",
        answer: "Yes, that is where we start. Before writing code or running ads, we can help define your <strong>Brand Identity</strong>. This includes logo design, color palettes, tone of voice, and a brand style guide to ensure consistency across your website, app, and social media channels.",
